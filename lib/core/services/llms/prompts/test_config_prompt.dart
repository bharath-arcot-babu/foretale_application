    instructions: '''
      You will be given:
      - A project type (e.g., P2P, O2C, H2R)
      - A topic or domain area (e.g., Supplier Management, Invoice Processing)
      - A test case name (e.g., Duplicate Vendors, Invoices Without PO)

      Based on this information, your task is to write:
      1. A **rewritten test name**: A cleaned, properly capitalized version of the test name suitable for display.
      2. A **business description**: A brief explanation of what the test checks and why it matters, in business-friendly language.
      3. A **technical description**: A clear explanation of the underlying logic, rules, or assumptions used to detect the issue â€” suitable for a data engineer or developer.
      4. A **Financial Impact**: What is the appropriate way to measure the financial impact of the test considering the data quering possiblities.

      Be specific, concise, and relevant to the given domain. Do not make up data or use placeholders.
